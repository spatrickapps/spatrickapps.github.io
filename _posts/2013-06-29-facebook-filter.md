I use Facebook a lot. A friend of mine doesn't quite get it, he said: "who cares about where _someone_ went or what _someone_ ate last weekend?" But after putting himself in my shoes, I think he got it, at least a little bit.

Being away from home in a foreign country, with most of my close friends back in Taiwan, Facebook is awesome for keeping up with how my friends are doing; especially nowadays some people think it is OK to send wedding invitations through Facebook.

But Facebook can be utterly annoying sometimes, your home stream can really easily be taken over by a stupid trend. Like after Miami Heat won, I, as someone who supported the Spurs, really don't need to see Heat's fans glow!!!

I was sure that there must be something out there, a Chrome extension that does exactly this. After a bit of search I found one that comes with 20 other features I don't need, so I was actually not that motivated to install it, or write one for myself for that matter. I just put up with it. 

Then a friend of mine started saying how he wanted to hide anything to do with NBA/ Miami Heat as well, I thought, building this for someone else to use is a lot more fun than building it for myself! So I replied saying: "I'm gonna build it!"

Hope next time it'd be something more practical. 乁( ◔ ౪◔)「
