[Zeczec](http://www.zeczec.com/) (my not-really-a-startup startup) and designer Han Lee had [a little collaboration project.](http://www.haniboi.com) It started simple and small. Han is a friend of us and he had previously launched [a successful project](http://www.zeczec.com/projects/haniboi) on zeczec. (we're a crowdfunding platform)

3 months ago, Han had this new idea with little people holding word signs, and at the time "no nukes" was a really big topic in Taiwan, people were asking him to make pictures like this for their facebook covers:

Not long after his 500th manually made people-holding-signs image, He contacted us for the idea of making an image generator, and immediately I said yes. I think for the most part it is that I hadn't really used Canvas before, and I couldn't find an excuse to use it, and this was perfect! Therefore, just like me facing any other exciting new projects, I dived right in and finished most of the code within couple of days. We decided to call it UPUP.

As a bigger plan, Han wants to make lots of products around this concept, toys, stickers, notebooks.... He planned to put it on zeczec to raise funding for them, so we agreed to put UPUP on hold until he's ready. 

We didn't make the generator public, and at the same time we didn't really think it's going to be anything even if we did. So we tested the generator publicly, I put it on GitHub, we test uploading to facebook and so on. No one cares about letting it get out, as it is so unlikely that it will blow up.

As time passed by, it was getting closer and closer to the date we planned to launch the project. We tested UPUP a few more times, and just like before, we didn't bother to hide it.

On 29 May, it got out, all of a sudden. Initially we noticed images being shared by a couple of friends but didn't think much of it, but suddenly it became 30 friends, then before we knew it, the generator is shared by the most popular local tech blog. We got 50,000 views in 5 hours, and the number of active users on site was soaring, going from 400 to 1800+.

We were not prepared at all, and we decided to shut it down(which was a questionable decision), and take some time to come up with a strategy. I was dead worried, thinking after we shut it down we might not be able to get it this popular again, it was just about to take off at the time... 

To most of our surprises, as soon as we took down the site with a notice saying: "We'll be back." (and etc,) the number of our facebook fans started soaring. While the site was up, we were gaining about 30 likes per hour, then after we took it down, it was 300 likes per hour! 

Then we decided to put it back on again on the 31 May for fear that people might lose interest.

Since then, [zeczec](https://www.facebook.com/zeczec.com)'s gained more than 30,000 facebook fans, UPUP has reached **1,200,000 pageviews**, been on [4 television news programs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg5F3v-PVD0&list=PLB_xus-d9BFus7wOV5OKopUy79zI3An37), numerous online medias, [metro newspaper in HongKong](http://epaper.skypost.hk/fileData/ePapers/20130603/1088240486/index.html#/12/zoomed), and [shared](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=516265595095796) by the lead signer of [Mayday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday_\(Taiwanese_band\)), [Gal Gadot](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151594249563926) of Fast and Furious, and more... all within 7 days.

We still don't know what exactly happened, and we've experienced the privilege and pain of being popular by being trolled heavily and said mean things to, and it hurts! These internet people are mean, do they know they're criticising a human being?

Anyway.

Lots of friends in Taiwan are congratulating us for this seemingly extremely successful campaign. We still don't have Han's big-picture project up on zeczec, and the hype is indeed likely to die down soon, but we had a great run.

It's our first million, lots of things went wrong, lots of things didn't go as planned and lots of opportunities were missed. It'd be nice if we were more prepared, but who'd know what would have happen if so? :)

By the way, you can [play it here](http://www.haniboi.com), this weekend we're dedicating the site to newly grads hence the dresses. :)
