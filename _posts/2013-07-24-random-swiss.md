Arrived at Zurich. 

The tram door closed on me, hitting on my tibia, hurt so much.

Got off the tram, was waiting to cross the street.<br />
Some random Swiss said: just cross.

After crossing, I tried to figure out which direction is the street I am looking for.<br />
That random Swiss has walked off for about 30 meters.<br />
Swiss looked back, paused, and walked back, asking "Are you looking for something?"

I pointed at the Google Maps, not knowing how to pronounce it.<br />
Swiss pointed at places, and said "I am walking that way as well"

Within a couple steps, I got tripped by a plank on the road and fell.<br />
Scratch my thumb, it bled a bit. My iPhone screen was shuttered.

Random Swiss asked me "Are you alright?"<br />
I said "Yes."<br />
Random Swiss asked again.<br />
I said "Yes."<br />
Random Swiss asked "Are you sure?"<br />
I said "Well there's nothing else I can do now."

We chatted. <br />
Then we found the road. Swiss asked me for the apartment number and walked me to it.

Swiss had been to Taipei for work before.<br />
Swiss sounded like some sort of mechnical engineer.<br />
Swiss said he then spent a week traveling the island, and like Taitung the most.<br />

We talked about how Taiwanese people are all so nice.<br />
People who live in the southern part of the island especially.<br />
They don't speak a word in English, but they want to help you SO MUCH as if it's their lives' mission.<br />
And you just smile and nod.

Then we found my place, the 24th.

Goodbye.
