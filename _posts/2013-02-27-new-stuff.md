Ever since GitHub added in those green dots on your profile page, I got mad and want to [colour them all green](https://github.com/muan). Well played, github.

This is working pretty well. I enjoy writing code, and colouring the dots is an effective drive for me. Regardless how stupid it sounds, it made me force myself to just find something to work on. I cannot help but feel a bit frustrated still for that since I started caring about the green dots I missed a few days, when would I be able to reach a one month streak?

I've just redesigned the blog, again.

Last weekend I made [Whac-a-Mu](http://muan.co/whacamu) for [Rob](http://robertheaton.com/)'s post [FeatureWhack](http://robertheaton.com/2013/02/24/featurewhack/). It was a great fun to make, but in the process of drawing the mole my brain cells did commit suicide in big batches. Fortunately I got it out still, and it became [my first dribbble shot](http://dribbble.com/shots/959536-Whac-A-Mu).

The highest score I can get is about 800, and it was just this one time; using touchpad had made me well off my game. How am I supposed to play counter-strike ever again?

The main reason why I am writing a blog now is so that I can fill the green dot for today, and I think this'll do. Good night y'all. :)
