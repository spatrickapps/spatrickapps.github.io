title: Installing Ruby on Rails on Windows (+ notes for Heroku)

For some reason I can’t find a straightforward and up-to-date version of this, so I just wrote this as I go.

1. [Download and install the latest ruby](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&release_id=5246).
During installation, make sure you tick the option to associate .rb files.

2. [Download and install Rubygems](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=126&release_id=2471).
Click setup.rb and let it run. Close the window when it says it is successfully installed.

3. [Download DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/). Follow [steps on github](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) to install it. (Scroll down to installation instructions.)

4. Use the same command prompt or open the command prompt again(right click to open as administrator if errored) and run ```$ gem install rails``` it will install a bunch of gems (rails and all its dependencies) and might take a while.

5. Install bundler buy running ```$ gem install bundler```. It’d again install stuff for a while, but there’s nothing to worry about. 

**And you're all set!**

Just go from your command prompt to an ideal directory and run ```$ rails new [appName]```, obviously change [appName] to a name of your choice to start your very first app on Windows!

This is really not as painful as I’ve heard, and the whole process might not take longer than an hour. (I have done only 2 installation on 2 laptops, the first time did take me a while, but the second time, following my own instruction, it was painless and fast)

And with Heroku, it is actually quite easy with [their documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart). Don’t think I need to explain more, just go ahead and follow the instructions.

However, there are a lot of errors for you to find along the path. Here's some of them:

1. Push failed with Heroku: Heroku ignores Windows Gemfile.lock. Go ahead and [delete these lines](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6811013/1388427) to fix it.

2. To set up postgreSQL on heroku, run ([refer to](https://postgres.heroku.com/blog/past/2012/4/26/heroku_postgres_development_plan/)):
    ```$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev```

3. 500 Internal Server error with Heroku: Could not find a JavaScript runtime. Added these lines to your Gemfile:
  {% highlight ruby %}
  group :production do
    gem ‘therubyracer’
  end{% endhighlight %}
  As I run sqlite on development and PG on production, I put `gem ‘pg’` in the group as well. Push, and remember to restart the server.

  \* Note that the Ruby Racer DOES NOT run on Windows.

Side note: If you run into problems with not being able to run either git/heroku on cmd,
[Here’s the fix for git](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4492979/git-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command)
For Heroku, shell says “The system cannot find the path specified,” the problem was that I installed Ruby in a unusual path, so I just went into “program files\Heroku\bin\heroku.bat” and edit the ruby path, and it was fixed.

**Update: 28 Jan 2013**

Just installed Rails again on my friend’s Windows machine, so I re-wrote some of the instructions, hope it’s a lot clearer now.

I got a new Mac a few month back, life is now a lot easier as a developer. But I cannot say it was painless the first time I set up rails on Mac, perhaps even more painful. The thing that made the difference was that a lot of the gems do not work on Windows, but they do on Mac. So if you’re installing Rails on Windows, you would still run into a lot of problems down the line with gems, it would be a good idea to at least start planning for a Mac. :)
